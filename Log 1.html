        <strong>noah.yasarturk</strong>: Hi team! Just to reiterate, I would appreciate it if everyone were able to define 2-3 tasks as specific as possible and record them in the associated Assignment 2 rough draft Google Doc by midnight tonight. I’ll have a rough rough draft finished tonight assuming I’m able to finish another assignment with expedience. I’ll let you know in a few minutes what Dr. Mussa says about our project insofar.

        <strong>noah.yasarturk</strong>: The meeting went very well. Unfortunately, we are going to need to pay for the Smartbulb API ourselves. I’m going to email Mr. Bryan to inquire about server space. Dr. Mussa said our web platform should be made in HTML as it would be impossible to incorporate the features we need to using Wix. &lt;@UB5ES17S4&gt; if you could research and provide us with information on the Smartbulb API, that would be fantastic. Mussa suggested we use Python to make the machine learning aspect as easy as possible, as Python has packages that make it all very easy. Matlab would make it even easier, but it is not open source.

Other than the regular softwares, we would be installing MySQL, Tableau, and whatever API Ricky would be working with. These are the ones that I can think of at the moment.

It’s incredible that you already have a plan for it, but for the time being our chief concern needs to be planning out tasks.


The hardware aspect also is concerned with the physical lightbulb and API. Paul Bryan said I’d need to email him:
-our names and student IDs
-what type of OS the server would be using
-how much storage we’d need
-how CPU-heavy the processes would be
-the type of research/project we’d be doing
-what software packages we’d be using
He needs all this info to authorize our server use.

        <strong>noah.yasarturk</strong>: Good morning team.

If you have checked the A2 draft, it should be immediately apparent that your glorious leader had bitten off more than he could chew. Check over it when you can today. 

I’d like it if some of you could fill out the “solution” section to the risk mitigation table; I’ll complete it if it remains unfinished this evening. 

The chief task for us to tackle together will be the scheduling table, as we need to all understand the tasks before we can estimate the time it will take to complete each. I will ABSOLUTELY need you guys’ help completing this table.

One last thing- I have the email for server reservation prepared, but I need to verify with you all my assumption that we’d likely need than 1 GB of server storage space, likely less even than 500 MB, as I relate to Mr. Bryan in my draft. In all of your opinions, would this be an accurate assumption? 

For our presentation, the scale we’d be operating on would be on only 1 theoretical business, and I don’t expect that we’d desire to bring this product to market, so in my opinion we should not need to consider the likelihood of adding additional buildings (save for 1 extra possibly to demonstrate how that feature would work) in our storage space estimate. Csv files don’t require that much space at all.

Please let me know ASAP so that I can send the email. I apologize for not being able to keep my promise of having the draft finished; it’s been a rather late night and I had other work that needed to be finished before I could start A2.

        <strong>noah.yasarturk</strong>: So sorry for the late reply &lt;@UB72FRHK9&gt; ! Let’s discuss it during our meeting today. I’ll be on the top floor of Aderhold at 9. If you’re unable to make it, that’s more than okay- we can discuss A2 virtually after class. 

Subjects for the meeting: A2, the video

I actually was unable to review any edits any of you had made to A2 yesterday last night, but I’ll be sure to investigate them today. The biggest thing I need from all of you (somewhat excluding &lt;@UB5B3G71N&gt;, as he will be doing enough with regards to the video) is help with the scheduling of tasks table. 

Let’s try and set a goal to record our voices by midnight tonight or as early as possible tomorrow so that Sean has time to compile them. I apologize for getting this out to you later than when most of you would need to begin your commute to meet on time; that’s on me. I promise I’ll do a better job going forward. 

Please gloss over our A2 draft this morning as early as you can. I’ll have my laptop open to it if this is untenable for you.

        <strong>noah.yasarturk</strong>: Alright team, I’ve just met with Mussa and we have a bit of an emergency we should address concurrently with our current tasks. I’ll outline the emergency after addressing a few items.

&lt;@UB5ES17S4&gt; to answer your questions:
1. We need BOTH use-case descriptions and diagrams
2. We’ll get feedback after each assignment, including A2
3. We can continuously update our requirements, including use-cases
4. The only change to A1 necessary was the change to the page number position

Now for the emergency.

        <strong>noah.yasarturk</strong>: We need to confirm that there is either:
A. Data available online pertaining to large-scale utility bills (think GA Power)
B. Data simulators available on the subject

Mussa said that data fabrication without the use of sample data is a large-scale project unto itself, requiring advanced mathematics. 

Our database will be accepting information from the smart lightbulb multiplied times however many lightbulbs may be in our theoretical building as well as from the utility bills. The issue I’m trying to express is that without a baseline idea of power consumption from a building, it’d require a significant amount of work to fabricate it.

If the data or a utility bill simulator is not available to us, we’re going to need to start a new project from near scratch.

Because of this, three of us are going to need to take on a new task. The tasks are as follows:
1. Research existence of utility bill data from our theoretical business clients
2. Research existence of utility bill data simulators
3. Come up with a new project idea to mitigate the risk of the data not being there

This problem is very abstract. I’m having trouble wrapping my head around it myself. Do I have any volunteers?

We’ll still need to complete the tasks we have on hand. I’ll think more on this after lunch.

If it is at all possible for any of you, I think we would benefit from a video conference call via Skype this morning perhaps at 10. Above all, we should discuss what data is necessary for our project to work as intended at each level. 

I’m finishing up the use-case diagram (I realize that my lack of productivity on this could mean &lt;@UB5B3G71N&gt; may not have time to put it into the video; apologies) and would like all of your evaluations of it as well. Let me know if this is at all possible for any of you, especially &lt;@UB5ES17S4&gt; and &lt;@UB72FRHK9&gt; . 

I’d also like to review the A2 draft and delete anything we won’t be including in the final version e.g. I’d guess we won’t be using both C and C++ on the backend.
