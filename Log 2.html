        <strong>noah.yasarturk</strong>: Good morning everyone. 
Be sure to read over Assignment 3 today.
&lt;@UB72FRHK9&gt; I’ve yet to receive word that our server is available, but I’ll be on campus by 2 and will stop by Paul Bryan’s office to check.
&lt;@UB5ES17S4&gt; anything you can do to initially fire up the bulb and play with it would be good.
&lt;@UB73LGZQF&gt; you and I should begin to think about how many pages we’ll need to design for the website.
&lt;@UB5B3G71N&gt; if you could investigate Tableau in terms of pricing or obtaining a log-in, that’d be ideal. Cynthia should have a good idea about this. Looking at the website, it appears to be very much not free.
I’ll be beginning to investigate our data sets and considering to what degree we’ll need to reformat it for our purposes as well as research machine learning to understand how we can implement the data set.

Good luck everyone!

        <strong>noah.yasarturk</strong>: To reiterate the changes that need to be made:
1. Remove the principal tasks and milestones section (let’s keep the table elsewhere in Drive)
2. Re-evaluate the staff changes section of risk mitigation (what if team member who leaves has a skill that is irreplaceable?)
3. Take out the project leader risk
4. Respecify effort (person-days) column as whole numbers corresponding to the number of people it will take to accomplish a task
5. Replan schedule considering solely this week, the system modeling phase (I have the schedule saved locally and will upload it to Drive to keep us on task)
6a. Redo the context model for system architecture (see figure 5.1 from book, slides. I’ll find appropriate edition 9 figure for reference)
6b. Insert the context model for system architecture prior to the system requirements as it is ordered in A2
7a. Rotate use-case diagram 90 degrees counter-clockwise 
7b. Insert use-case diagram prior to use-case descriptions

Let me know if I’m missing something.

        <strong>noah.yasarturk</strong>: Alright team, thank you for your patience.

Thank you to Ricky for stepping up and fixing up our document.

We need to figure out an exact time/place to meet Friday. Would meeting on campus work well for everyone? If not, can you all provide me with where you live (city-wise) so I can figure out a central location? Let’s try and meet up at 10.

Luckily, due to our performance on A2, A3 will be far easier. Since Ricky has already finished 1-4 of my prior post, that only leaves from the prior week a few formatting items (6-7), the architecture context model, and the replanning by week. 

From A3, the new things we’ll need to address are as such: 
1.) Reformat the Requirements into the format Mussa specified.
-given that Mussa praises us as being only 1/2 groups to do this successfully, this should be quite easy.
2.) Create tests for each of the requirements. (e on A3).
3a.) Create class diagrams
3b.) Create the system class diagram
4.) Create system sequence diagram
5.) Specify system database tables
6.) Specify database management system type

I’ll allocate you to these tasks promptly.
KEEP IN MIND WE NEED TO BE ACTUALLY DEVELOPING THE SYSTEM ASAP, and that means we should consider the overarching schedule I made prior to stay on task.

        <strong>noah.yasarturk</strong>: Here’s how we can plan to tackle A3:

&lt;@UB5ES17S4&gt;
-Reformat req 7 and create a test for it
-Reformat req 3 and create a test for it
-Create “Register new user” class diagram
-Create “Smartbulb API functionality class diagram
-Assist me in creating system database tables

&lt;@UB73LGZQF&gt;  
-Reformat req 4 and create test for it
-Reformat req 5 and create test for it
-Redo architecture context model

&lt;@UB5B3G71N&gt; 
-Edit video
-Reformat req 8 and create test for it
-Create “Dashboard Display Functionality” class diagram

&lt;@UB72FRHK9&gt; 
-Reformat req 2 and create test for it
-Reformat req 6 and create test for it
-Specify database management type
-Create “Database Functionality” class diagram (&lt;@UB5ES17S4&gt; can tag in)
-Create “Machine Learning Functionality” class diagram

Me:
-Reformat req 1 and create test for it
-Replan the schedule by week
-Create system sequence diagram
-Specify system database tables and Primary and Foreign keys 
-Create system class diagram (may need to wait until all others are finished with their class diagrams prior)

In addition to the above which are needed to complete A3, &lt;@UB73LGZQF&gt; needs to attempt to complete an initial draft of the website template via MS Paint or something similar displaying his intentions for the front-end design; &lt;@UB5B3G71N&gt; and I can tag in on this task. 

Does this sound fair?

1. Class diagrams just need to be Class names and their relationships. Attributes and methods are optional, however, they will be necessary for A4, so the more we do now the less work we have next week.
2. We only need to add aggregation models to our class diagram if they are necessary in our system.
3. Class diagrams should be made before sequence diagram, then following the sequence diagram, the ERD. 
4. The essentials needed for the ERD are making the tables and their normalizations (defining primary and foreign keys)
